## Produce the error

Init cdk app with latest version:

```bash
npx cdk init app --language typescript
```

Add following code snippet to your stack:

```ts filename-app-stack.ts
const mybucket = new aws_s3.Bucket(this, 'mybucket2', {
  publicReadAccess: true,
  removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});
```
Before April 2023, this code snippet would create public S3 bucket without any problem. But today you get following error while making deployment:
![s3 PutBucketPolicy Access Denied](/images/posts/resolve-api-s3-putbucketpolicy-access-denied/access-denied.png)


## What causes the problem?
As April 2023, Amazon S3 implemented changes to the default settings when creating a new bucket. These changes aim to improve security and include the following modifications:
- Enabling S3 Block Public Access
- Disabling S3 access control lists (ACLs)


You can read their blog post in [here](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/amazon-s3-automatically-enable-block-public-access-disable-access-control-lists-buckets-april-2023/) to learn more.

## Resolve the error

We configure the Block Public Access settings on bucket level by adding blockPublicAccess prop. 

```ts filename-app-stack.ts
const mybucket = new aws_s3.Bucket(this, 'mybucket2', {
  publicReadAccess: true,
  blockPublicAccess: new aws_s3.BlockPublicAccess({
    blockPublicPolicy: false,
    restrictPublicBuckets: false,
    blockPublicAcls: true, 
    ignorePublicAcls: true,
  }),
  removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});
```

- We prevent accessing the bucket through ACLs by assigning true to blockPublicAcls and ignorePublicAcls keys. You can read more about them [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-options:~:text=your%20S3%20buckets-,Block%20public%20access%20settings,-S3%20Block%20Public).
- By assigning false to `blockPublicPolicy`, we enable putting Bucket policy that allows public access on bucket.
- By assigning false to `restrictPublicBuckets`, we remove the restriction that only authorized users can access the bucket.
- Below image demonstrates the result on S3 console Block public access (bucket settings) after blockPublicAccess is configured:
![s3-block-public-access-settings](/images/posts/resolve-api-s3-putbucketpolicy-access-denied/s3-block-public-access-settings.png)
- In S3 console, we can also see the public bucket policy, which we were able to set after the configuration, which is defined by the `publicReadAccess: true` configuration:
